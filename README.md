## Deprecation notice
I no longer maintain this repo. Please see [SixAiy's actively maintained fork](https://github.com/SixAiy/GensokyoBot). 
SixAiy is also taking care of hosting the bot.

## Instructions

This bot is a fork of FredBoat. Most features of FredBoat have been removed or replaced in favour of offering streaming from a single source.
The bot is optimized in such a way that only one stream is opened to the source.
